# Performance Analysis & Visualization of Web Frameworks in a RESTful Microservices Architecture

This repository contains implementations of basic CRUD microservices using **FastAPI**, and **Express.js**. 
It provides a benchmarking setup with:

- **k6** â€“ load testing  
- **Prometheus** â€“ metrics collection  
- **Grafana** â€“ performance visualization  

The goal is to evaluate and compare these frameworks under various load scenarios, focusing on **latency**, **throughput**, and **resource utilization** in a microservices environment.
